- 👋 Hi, I’m @BlueOpDevBlueOpal
- 👀 I’m interested in solving complex problems, using software to help solve said problems; also cars and great food (esp if bacon is involved)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:  all I don't know about development, applied math, and throwing French in to make sure boredom is avoided (I'm really bad at...all 3)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on problem solving, learning (what I don't know), UX (which I do know)
- 📫 How to reach me BlueOpDev@BlueOpalTech.com
